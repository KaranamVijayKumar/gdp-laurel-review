# About the Laurel Review

The Laurel Review is a biannual print magazine seeking submissions of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, script, review, and those that blur the lines between genres. They seek both established and new voices in the writing world, and  are especially interested in writing by those whose identities have been historically under-represented. Submitters living outside of the United States are encouraged to submit. Translations in various genres are also of interest. All accepted submitters will receive two copies of the issue in which their piece(s) appear/s.
