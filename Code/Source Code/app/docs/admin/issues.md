##### List Issues

Issues are listed by their creation date in descending order (latest Issue is on top). Clicking on the Issue name
will allow you to display the [issue overview](issues/show). Under the issue name you can find the short description
of the issue. 

* <span class="btn btn--tiny btn--secondary i-globe" > View</span> - enabled, visible by the site visitors; clicking on it will take you to the issue on the site.
* <span class="btn btn--tiny btn--secondary btn--disabled i-globe"> View</span> - disabled, not visible to visitors

Clicking on the thumbnail image allows you to view the Issue's cover page.

On the right of the issue it is visible when the issue was created (hover on the "Created ..." and you can see the exact time).
Also the status of the issue is also visible on the right.
 
**Note:** On mobile devices the right side information may be hidden.
 
##### Search
