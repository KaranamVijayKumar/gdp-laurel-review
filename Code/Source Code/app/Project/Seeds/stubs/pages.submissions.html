    The Laurel Review prints poetry, short fiction, essays and reviews. Aesthetic schools don't matter to us; what
    matters is that the poem or story or essay presents a real investigation of the art and what it is to be human.

    We read from September 1 to May 1, and we try to reply promptly. Simultaneous Submissions are welcome, but please
    notify us immediately if your piece is taken elsewhere. We prefer a submission be three to six poems or a single
    story or essay. In short, we want good poems and stories, we hope to be able to recognize them when we get them, and
    we print what we believe to be the best work submitted.

    Please note that there is a two dollar administrative fee for online submissions.
